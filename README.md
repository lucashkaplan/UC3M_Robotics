# UC3M Robotics Final Project

This set of C++ programs served as the final project for my Robotics course at University Carlos III de Madrid, which I attended while studying abroad in Spain in the spring of 2022. In this project, I created a set of programs to guide a virtual robot from the top of an obstacle course to its bottom, after which it would search for two green poles. Once the robot identified a pole, it drove to it, flagged the pole by stopping, and then searched for the next one. After identifying each pole, the robot navigated back to the top of the obstacle course. The code produced worked for all six provided obstacle courses, each with their own challenges and pole positions. The simulated robot runs were completed using the Webots application.
